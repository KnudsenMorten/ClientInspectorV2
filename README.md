# Introduction to ClientInspector (v2)
![ClientInspector](img/ClientInspector_300.png)

**Are you in control?** - or are some of your core infrastructure processes like **patching, antivirus, bitlocker enablement** drifting? Or would you like to do **advanced inventory**, where you can lookup your **warranty state** against Lenovo or Dell warranty, then keep reading.

Check out **ClientInspector**, which can help you get **great insight** to your complete **client environment**.

ClientInspector is **free** to the community - built to be a **cool showcase** of how you can bring back **data** from your clients using **Azure Log Ingestion Pipeline**, **Azure Data Collection Rules**, **Azure LogAnalytics**; view them with **Azure Monitor & Azure Dashboards** - and get "drift-alerts" using **Microsoft Sentinel**.

### Archicture & flow of ClientInspector
ClientInspector (v2) is uploading the collected data into **custom logs** in **Azure LogAnalytics workspace** - using **Log ingestion API**, **Azure Data Collection Rules (DCR)** and **Azure Data Collection Endpoints (DCE)**.

#### Disclaimer
It is important for me to state that I'm not trying to build a separate management tool, which will compete with Microsoft security and management stack. 

Nothing beats Microsoft Azure/M365 management and security stack. They are rock star solutions. 

But I'm really **passioned** about the **logging capabilities** and the power **to bring data back from clients, servers, cloud and 3rd party systems** - and getting **cool valueable information out of the data**.

I have a similar solution for **servers** - **ServerInspector**. Unfortunately, it is not public.

[Big Thanks to the great people in Microsoft product teams - you are rock stars :smile:](#thank-you-to-the-great-people-in-microsoft-product-teams---you-are-rock-stars-smile)

Happy hunting :smile:

# What data is being collected ?
**ClientInspector** can be used to collect lots of great information of from your **Windows clients** - and send the data to **Azure LogAnalytics Custom Tables**.

The script collects the following information (settings, information, configuration, state):
1.  User Logged On to Client
2.  Computer information - bios, processor, hardware info, Windows OS info, OS information, last restart
3.  Installed applications, both using WMI and registry
4.  Antivirus Security Center from Windows - default antivirus, state, configuration
5.  Microsoft Defender Antivirus - all settings including ASR, exclusions, realtime protection, etc
6.  Office - version, update channel config, SKUs
7.  VPN client - version, product
8.  LAPS - version
9.  Admin By Request (3rd party) - version
10. Windows Update - last result (when), windows update source information (where), pending updates, last installations (what)
11. Bitlocker - configuration
12. Eventlog - look for specific events including logon events, blue screens, etc.
13. Network adapters - configuration, installed adapters
14. IP information for all adapters
15. Local administrators group membership
16. Windows firewall - settings for all 3 modes
17. Group Policy - last refresh
18. TPM information - relavant to detect machines with/without TPM

# Source data - what data can I use ?
You can use **any source data** which can be retrieved into Powershell (wmi, cim, external data, rest api, xml-format, json-format, csv-format, etc.)

It is very important to understand, that the data typically needs to be manipulated before sending them - to ensure they are valid and any irrelevant data has been removed.

ClientInspector uses all of the 24 functions within the Powershell module, **AzLogDcIngestPS**, to handle source data manipulation to **remove "noice" in data**, to **rename prohibited colums in tables/DCR** - and support needs for **transparency** with extra insight like **UserLoggedOn**, **CollectionTime**, **Computer**:

# Desired State Dashboards - How to get insight of my environment from the data ?
As part of the initial deployment using [ClientInSpectorV2-DeploymentKit](https://github.com/KnudsenMorten/ClientInspectorV2-DeploymentKit), you will have access to lots of Azure Dashboards and Azure Workbooks. 

[Video - Dashboards](https://youtu.be/0MKPgzvDNRk)  

The idea of the dashboards is that they will show where your infrastucture is drifting from 'desired state'. Think of them as KPIs, where the infrastructure is not in control.

Instead of having a task with patching and managing antivirus, you can consider to have KPIs, which will show, where computers are **not** patched - or where realtime protection in anvirus is **not** running - or machines which **has bluescreened** during the last 24 hours.

This is the same concept as **Microsoft Secure Score**.

## Can I make my own workbooks & dashboards - yes, you can :smile:
If you want to add more dashboards or workbooks, you will typically start by investigating the collected data in the custom logs tables using KQL quries. When you have found the desired query, you can make new views in workbooks - and pin your favorites to your dashboards.

<br>

# How do I query the data? - Kusto (KQL) is the answer
If you don't know Kusto language, I recommend you to start playing around with it, as it is a really powerful language.

[Video - Kusto queries against data](https://youtu.be/_GlI0h7ZOsg)  
[Video - Dashboards](https://youtu.be/0MKPgzvDNRk)  

[Write your first query with Kusto Query Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/write-first-query-kusto-query-language/)

[Analyze query results using KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-results-kusto-query-language/)

Below are 4 samples of queries to get you started - baed on the data from ClientInspector.

## Sample query 1: Advanced hunting using Kusto (KQL) query
If you want to do advanced hunting, you can use traditional Kusto (KQL) queries in the tables

## Sample query 4: Integrating data with other sources (warrantycheck against Lenovo warranty-database)
When we have the data in Azure LogAnalytics, we can start to integrate the data with other sources, like Dell or Lenovo warranty data via REST api lookup.

[Video - Sample usage of data - lookup against Lenovo warranty db](https://youtu.be/3ZDyTwiLU0w)  

Here is an example of output, which was auto-created by a powershell script - extracting a list of computers & serial number - and then doing lookup to Lenovo warranty database to retrieve information about when the computer was purchased - and its warranty state.

[Sample warranty output (Excel), based on data collected by ClientInspector](https://github.com/KnudsenMorten/ClientInspectorV2/raw/main/img/WarrantyInfo.xlsx)

# Archicture, Schema & flow of ClientInspector
ClientInspector (v2) is uploading the collected data into **custom logs** in **Azure LogAnalytics workspace** - using **Log ingestion API**, **Azure Data Collection Rules (DCR)** and **Azure Data Collection Endpoints (DCE)**. 

![Archicture](docs/ArchitectureV2.png)

## Schema
The crucial part of learning sending data through Azure Pipeline and DCRs are the schema. Both the DCR and LogAnalytics table needs to be matching the schema of the source object. ClientInspector with the usage of functions in AzLogDcrIngestPS module will handle these steps automatically.

[Video - Automatic creation of 2 tables & DCRs (verbose mode)](https://youtu.be/rIUNs3yT-eI)  
[Video - Automatic creation of 2 tables & DCRs (normal mode)](https://youtu.be/khQMDcON6r8)  
[Video - See schema of DCR and table)](https://youtu.be/NDSNhvpa4Gs)

## Networking
You have 3 options for connectivity to Azure for data upload: 

**Internet-connected endpoints - OS-level compliance**
1) REST endpoint sends to DCE via public IP of DCE (public access)
2) REST endpoint sends to DCE via private link of DCE (private access)

**No Internet access or OS-level incompliance fx. running TLS 1.0/1.1**
3) REST endpoint sends data via [log-hub](https://github.com/KnudsenMorten/AzLogDcrIngestPSLogHub) - a concept I have built. 

### Internet-connected endpoints - OS-level compliance
![Internet-connected endpoints - OS-level compliance](docs/Networking.png)

### No Internet access or OS-level incompliance fx. running TLS 1.0/1.1
![No Internet access or OS-level incompliance fx. running TLS 1.0/1.1](docs/LogHub.png)


You need to allow the following endpoints in your firewall:
|Endpoint|Purpose|Port|Direction|Bypass HTTPS Inspection|
|:-------|:------|:----|:-------|:----------------------|
|global.handler.control.monitor.azure.com|Access control service|Port 443|Outbound|Yes|
|dce logs ingestion uri<br><br>sample<br>https://dce-log-platform-management-client-demo-p-iur0.westeurope-1.ingest.monitor.azure.com|Ingest logs data|Port 443|Outbound|Yes|

<br>

# Implementation
<details>
  <summary>Azure components used as part of ClientInspector - and their purpose?</summary>

<br>

The following components are needed:

| Azure Resource                | Purpose                                           | More information |
| :-------------                | :-----                                            | :-----           |
| Any REST endpoint             | This is the source sending data                   |                  |
| Log Ingestion API             | This is the new API that replaces the old HTTP Data Collector API | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-ingestion-api-overview |
| Data Collection Endpoint (DCE)| This is the entry point of communication from the endpoint. Data is sent to a **Azure Data Collection Endpoint Ingestion Uri**. A single DCE can support multiple DCRs, so you can specify a different DCR for different sources and target tables. | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-endpoint-overview?tabs=portal |
| Data Collection Rules (DCR)   | Data collection rules define data collected (schema) and specify how and where that data should be sent or stored. The DCR must understand the structure of the input data and the structure of the target table. If the two don't match, it can use a transformation to convert the source data to match the target table. You can also use the transformation to filter source data and perform any other calculations or conversions. | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview | 
| Azure LogAnaltyics Workspace  | Data is sent to custom logs in Azure LogAnalytics  | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview |
| Azure Workbooks               | As part of the deployment, sample workbooks will be deployed  | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview |
| Azure Dashboards              | As part of the deployment, sample workbooks will be deployed  | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards |
| Kusto (KQL)                   | Data can be analyzed using Kust (KQL) queries | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/get-started-queries |

</details>

The steps to setup ClientInspector in your environment are:
1. [Setup environment using ClientInSpectorV2-DeploymentKit](https://github.com/KnudsenMorten/ClientInspectorV2-DeploymentKit)

2. Run ClientInspector the first time (initial setup) - see more below
<details>
  <summary>How to configure the initial setup of Azure LogAnalytics tables and Data Collection Rules (first-time)</summary>

<br>
I recommend to have a reference computer, which is used for table/DCR management. This way it is a controlled process, if changes must be made for example change of data structure
<br>
Configuration:

1. When you run the DeploymentKit, it will automatically prepare the ClientInspector file for you, so you just need to insert the variables

2. Verify the variables have been inserted
```js
$TenantId                                   = "xxxx" 
$LogIngestAppId                             = "xxxx" 
$LogIngestAppSecret                         = "xxxx" 

$DceName                                    = "xxxx" 
$LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId            = "xxxx"

$AzDcrPrefixClient                          = "xxx" 
$AzDcrSetLogIngestApiAppPermissionsDcrLevel = $false
$AzDcrLogIngestServicePrincipalObjectId     = "xxx" 
$AzDcrDceTableCreateFromReferenceMachine    = @()
$AzDcrDceTableCreateFromAnyMachine          = $true
```

3. Start Powershell as local admin

4. Start the script using this command
```js
C:\ClientInspector\ClientInspector.ps1 -verbose:$true
```

5. It wil now run for 10-15 min and create the necessary tables & Data Collection Rules - based on the actual structure in your environment

6. When first run of the script has completed, then run it again. Now data will be sent into the solution.

7. Verify data is coming in using Kusto queries in the different tables. NOTE: In can take approx 10-15 min for the first upload of data, as the pipeline needs to be created in backend

8. As the last change, we need to change 2 parameters in the parameters to tell ClientInspector to only make schema changes when run from the reference machine
```js
$AzLogDcrTableCreateFromReferenceMachine    = @("<<MyReferenceMachineComputerName>>")   # sample @("ComputerName")
$AzLogDcrTableCreateFromAnyMachine          = $false    # important so changes can only happen on reference machine
```
9. You are now ready to deploy it to your test group

</details>

3. Setup deployment job to let ClientInspector run every day to collect the inventory. You can run the ClientInspector script using your favorite deployment tool. Scripts for Microsoft Intune and ConfigMgr (or any other tool running a CMD-file) are provided. 
<details>
  <summary>How to deploy using Microsoft Intune ?</summary>

<br>
  You will run the inventory script using the method remediation script in Microsoft Intune.
  
1. [Download the detection script ClientInspector_Detection.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KnudsenMorten/ClientInspectorV2/main/Intune/ClientInspector_Detection.ps1)

2. Open the file with your favorite editor. Adjust the frequency on how often you want the inventory to run
```js
##################################
# VARIABLES
##################################

    $RunEveryHours    = 8
    $LastRun_RegPath  = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\ClientInspector"
    $LastRun_RegKey   = "ClientInSpector_System"
```
3. Now we need to create the remediation job. Go into Microsoft Intune portal -> Reports -> Endpoint Analysis --> Proactive remediations - and create a script package as shown below

NOTE: For remediation script, use the **ClientInspector.ps1** file

![Flow](img/Intune-remediation-1.png)

![Flow](img/Intune-remediation-2.png)

![Flow](img/Intune-remediation-3.png)

![Flow](img/Intune-remediation-4.png)

![Flow](img/Intune-remediation-5.png)

</details>


<details>
  <summary>How to deploy using ConfigMgr (or any other tool running a CMD-file) ?</summary>
  
<br>
You will run the inventory script by a traditional package / deployment
    
1. [Download the CMD-file ClientInspector.cmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KnudsenMorten/ClientInspectorV2/ConfigMgr/ClientInspector.cmd)

2. Create a source structure on your ConfigMgr package source directory for example called ClientInspector. 

3. Copy the 2 needed files **ClientInspector.cmd** and **ClientInspector.ps1** into the directory

4. Make a package - and point the package to run **ClientInspector.cmd**

5. Make a deployment

# Dependencies

## Powershell module AzLogDcringestPS - built by me (Morten Knudsen)

ClientInspector requires the Powershell module, **AzLogDcrIngestPS**

Core features of Powershell module **AzLogDcrIngestPS**:
* create/update the DCRs and tables automatically - based on the source object schema
* validate the schema for naming convention issues. If exist found, it will mitigate the issues
* update schema of DCRs and tables, if the structure of the source object changes
* auto-fix if something goes wrong with a DCR or table
* can remove data from the source object, if there are colums of data you don't want to send
* can convert source objects based on CIM or PS objects into PSCustomObjects/array
* can add relevant information to each record like UserLoggedOn, Computer, CollectionTime

You can find more detailed information about the module using links below:

# Running ClientInspector.ps1 - 3 modes
ClientInspector supports 3 ways to install/update/import the needed Powershell module: **Download**, **PsGallery**, **LocalPath**

By default, it will download latest version from PsGallery into CurrentUser scope.

## .\ClientInspector.ps1 -function:LocalPath
ClientInspector will look for **AzLogDcrIngest.psm1** file in the directory where the script will run from. 
If AzLogDcrIngest.psm1 is missing, script will terminate - otherwise it will do an import-module.

Example
```
.\ClientInspector.ps1 -verbose:$false -function:localpath

ClientInspector | Inventory of Operational & Security-related information
Developed by Morten Knudsen, Microsoft MVP - for free community use

Using AzLogDcrIngestPS module from local path D:\scripts\ClientInspectorV2
```

## .\ClientInspector.ps1 -function:Download
ClientInspector will download latest version from my Github repo and store it in the local path each time it runs (approx 300 kb)

Example
```
.\ClientInspector.ps1 -verbose:$false -function:download

ClientInspector | Inventory of Operational & Security-related information
Developed by Morten Knudsen, Microsoft MVP - for free community use

Downloading latest version of module AzLogDcrIngestPS from https://github.com/KnudsenMorten/CientInspectorV2
into local path D:\scripts\ClientInspectorV2

```

## .\ClientInspector.ps1 -function:PsGallery -scope [AllUsers|CurrentUser]
This parameter requires another parameter: -scope [AllUsers | CurrentUser]

ClientInspector will check if the module is installed in the chosen scope.
If not installed, it will automatically download latest version from Powershell Gallery and import-module.
If client is running latest version, it will continue.

Example
```
.\ClientInspector.ps1 -verbose:$false -function:PSGallery -scope:CurrentUser

ClientInspector | Inventory of Operational & Security-related information
Developed by Morten Knudsen, Microsoft MVP - for free community use

Powershell module was not found !

# Security
The security of **ClientInspector** are divided into 4 layers: **data-in**, **data-upload** (send to backend) and **data-view** (dashboards) - and **schema-management**

| Phase | Security Implementation |Delegations / Permissions|
|:------|:------------------------|:------------------------|
|Data-in (collection)|This phase is controlled by the method you choose to do the actual collection (Intune, ConfigMg or other 3rd party)|Script needs to run as local admin (system context) to be able to collect core data from hardware & Windows
|Data-upload|Authentication for the Logs Ingestion API is performed at the DCE, which uses standard Azure Resource Manager authentication.<br><br>A common strategy is to use an application ID and application key which is also the method used in ClientInspector.<br><br>Azure AppId & Secret are stored in the header of ClientInspector for simplicity purpose<br><br>It is also possible to use Azure Keyvault for storing the AppId and Secret|[Details covered in ClientInspectV2-DeploymentKit](https://github.com/KnudsenMorten/ClientInspectorV2-DeploymentKit#security-1)
|Data-view|Azure RCAC permissions|Give access to your Azure LogAnalytics, Azure Workbooks and Azure Dashboards|
|Schema-management|Method 1: Azure RBAC (recommended)<br><br>Method 2:Azure app with secret or certificate|[Details covered in ClientInSpectorV2-DeploymentKit](https://github.com/KnudsenMorten/ClientInspectorV2-DeploymentKit#azure-rbac-security-adjustment-separation-of-permissions-between-log-ingestion-and-tabledcr-management)

# Layout of ClientInspector data-set
Each of the data-sets (bios, applications, bitlocker, etc.) are built with the same 4-phased structure:

## step 1/4 - Variables (naming - where to send the data)
```
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variables
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
$TableName  = 'InvClientComputerInfoSystemV2'   # must not contain _CL
$DcrName    = "dcr-" + $AzDcrPrefixClient + "-" + $TableName + "_CL"
```


## step 2/4 - Data Collection
```
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Collecting data (in)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Collecting Computer system information ... Please Wait !"

$DataVariable = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem
```

## step 3/4 - Data Manipulation (ensure data is in correct format and any "noice" was removed and relevant information has been added)
```
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Preparing data structure
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# convert CIM array to PSCustomObject and remove CIM class information
$DataVariable = Convert-CimArrayToObjectFixStructure -data $DataVariable -Verbose:$Verbose

# add CollectionTime to existing array
$DataVariable = Add-CollectionTimeToAllEntriesInArray -Data $DataVariable -Verbose:$Verbose

# add Computer & UserLoggedOn info to existing array
$DataVariable = Add-ColumnDataToAllEntriesInArray -Data $DataVariable -Column1Name Computer -Column1Data $Env:ComputerName  -Column2Name UserLoggedOn -Column2Data $UserLoggedOn

# Validating/fixing schema data structure of source data
$DataVariable = ValidateFix-AzLogAnalyticsTableSchemaColumnNames -Data $DataVariable -Verbose:$Verbose

# Aligning data structure with schema (requirement for DCR)
$DataVariable = Build-DataArrayToAlignWithSchema -Data $DataVariable -Verbose:$Verbose
```

## step 4/4 - Data Out (send to LogAnalytics) - combined functions
```
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create/Update Schema for LogAnalytics Table & Data Collection Rule schema
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CheckCreateUpdate-TableDcr-Structure -AzLogWorkspaceResourceId $LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId  `
                                     -AzAppId $LogIngestAppId -AzAppSecret $LogIngestAppSecret -TenantId $TenantId -Verbose:$Verbose `
                                     -DceName $DceName -DcrName $DcrName -TableName $TableName -Data $DataVariable `

                                     -AzLogDcrTableCreateFromReferenceMachine $AzLogDcrTableCreateFromReferenceMachine

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Upload data to LogAnalytics using DCR / DCE / Log Ingestion API
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

## step 4/4 - Data Out (send to LogAnalytics) - detailed functions - "under the hood"
```
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Check if table and DCR exist - or schema must be updated due to source object schema changes
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
